# Analysis and plotting tools for PROTEUS outputs

This collection of Jupyter notebooks can be used to analyse and plot data from PROTEUS.
It is especially directed to analysing grids of models, such as when studying how particular
variables and processes change planetary evolution.

These notebooks were used to produce Nicholls+2024a and Nicholls+2024b.
